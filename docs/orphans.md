A simple neural-network explanation can account for \citeA{johansen2007paradoxical}'s.
In a simple network, the rare feature develops stronger connections with the category label.
Compound features share the connection with the category label, so any update to these connections dissipates between them.
There is no need to relocate attention to reduce errors, therefore attention will not bias responding toward the rare label.
But stronger $C \to rare$ feature-label connections will result in a rare bias on BC compounds during the test phase.
This is strong evidence for the assymetric cognitive representation, but it still builds on the presence of explicit prediction error.
In order to investigate the role of prediction error in response to feedback, we need to tweak their observational learning condition to conform to a more canonical implementation of the procedure.
This will involve reimplementing the shared feature.
Our current study modified the canonical IBRE procedure in an attempt to remove components from the design that is associated with explicit prediction error.
This contrasts Experiment 2 in \citeA{johansen2007paradoxical}, who tried to remove the shared cue that pushed attention towards C during training in response to prediction error.
Here, we strictly focus on prediction error as the element of the experimental procedure.

# Discussion

Compared to \citeA{johansen2007paradoxical}, we also do not consider asymmetric representation and base-rate neglect as necessary conditions.
We consider them to result from the environmental conditions specified in the experiment required for the IBRE as opposed to being necessary/sufficient conditions for the IBRE.
From our point of view, they are theoretical constructs.
They are not part of the experimental design.

\cite{johansen2007paradoxical} gave evidence that even the overlapping features are not necessary.
In their design, common category exemplars were made up of two features, while rare exemplars only had a single feature - disjoint cues.
This can mean that common exemplars need to be composed of at least two features, while the rare exemplar must have only one feature.
If the rare exemplar has one uniquely predictive feature and another feature that is not shared with the other category, we do not observe the effect.
This is the shared-cue effect \cite{kruschke2001inverse, wills2014attention}.
One can hypothesise that the shared cue and the disjoint cue are sufficient conditions, but at least one of them is necessary.
In addition, one can hypothesise that in the absence of a shared feature, common exemplars must contain more features than rare exemplars.
